## 1. Project Overview

This project is an ALGOSUP project, driven by the students. This project aims to create a Frogger game with a FPGA Go Board coded with Verilog. It's a game whose the aim is to cross the map from bottom to top, avoiding obstacles.

**Story**

Ranck is a frog who has been separated from his love and needs to browse the city and its dangerous roads.

## 2. Project Scope

To create the Frogger, we defined some requierements:

1. Recreate the basic game (map, character, obstacles)
2. Add menu
3. Add score
4. Add Bonuses
5. Multiples levels and difficulties
6. Add differents themes

## 3. Project Deliverable

The project will be rythmed by deadlines fixed by the school. The milestones for the project are the following:

- 10/07/2024: Functional Specifications
- 10/14/2024: Technical Specifications
- 10/21/2024: Test Plan
- 10/21/2024: User Manual
- 10/21/2024: Final Product

## 4. Cost

The budget for this project is limited to the material provided at the beginning of the project.
About the time spend on the project, we have at least 45h30 without overtime.

## 5. Risks

- **Time**: We only have 4 weeks to complete the project, and might run out of time if we encounter too many problems.
In this case, we will prioritise the tasks according to the order defined in [scope](#2-project-scope).
- **Problem with the provided hardware**: We might encounter problems with the hardware that we won't be able to fix.
In this case, we will have to find a workaround or change the scope of the project to use the time we have left to work on another feature.
- **Hardware breakdown**: We could break the hardware while working on it.
In this case, we will try to borrow the device of another team.
