In agreement with the whole team, the following rules have been defined below:

- Respect for each other through an adapted vocabulary
- English is the primary language during project periods. This will enable you to learn vocabulary and practice speaking naturally during the 5-week project.
- Punctuality is essential for the successful completion of the project. Any delay or absence during the project without having notified the Project Manager or without a valid reason will be reimbursed up to 50% in addition to the basic hours.

There are several levels of sanctions:

- A warning for each violation.
- Three warnings and a detailed report will be sent to the superior entity.
