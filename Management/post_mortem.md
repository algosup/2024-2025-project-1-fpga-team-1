**Introduction**

The post-mortem is a document which is made a the end of the project, to allow to the team to tell what it work or not during all the project. It's a way to learn about all errors made but also to talk with all the team.

## Success

There was good understanding throughout most of the project, with each member helping the other. Everyone was able to participate and bring their own point of view to the game. Everyone was motivated to learn and get as involved as possible in the project. Despite the difficulties and some delays in the schedule, we're proud of the final result and the progress we've made to catch up.

## What could have gone better

There were some communication problems and a desire to put oneself and one's point of view forward. The management could have been stricter at certain points to avoid this. Progress was quite slow at the beginning, which created a delay in the schedule, but could have been avoided if everyone had been able to properly explain their point of view in order to help find solutions more easily.

## Suggestions for the next project

Léna would do her job differently, by getting straight to the point. Grégory would adopt a slightly more rigorous management style, with more severity and better communication, with a daily meeting at the beginning and end of the session.

## Conclusion

The atmosphere was generally pleasant, with a motivated and committed team ready to help us move forward together. Despite this, there are still a few points that need to be improved for greater efficiency, but they won't have a major impact on the current project.
