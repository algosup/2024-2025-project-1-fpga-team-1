### I. Project Introduction

- **A. Client**
  - The **FroggyRanck** project is a reimagining of the arcade game **Frogger** on an **FPGA** board.
  - Developed to provide a retro gaming experience with custom features.
  - Aimed at a playful and educational audience.

- **B. Project Objective**
  - To recreate a game on FPGA where the player controls a frog that must cross a road filled with cars to reach its destination.
  - Includes VGA display mechanisms and hardware controls (buttons on the board).

### II. Solution

- **A. Description**
  - Developed in **Verilog** on the **[FPGA board name]**.
  - Display managed via VGA, with the player using the board's buttons to move the frog.
  - Each level becomes progressively more difficult with an increase in the number of obstacles.

- **B. Components**
  - **1. Frog (Player)**
    - Controlled using the directional buttons on the FPGA board.
    - Frog sprite displayed on the VGA screen.
  
  - **2. Cars (Obstacles)**
    - Randomly generated cars moving horizontally.
    - Variable speed of cars to increase difficulty.
  
  - **3. Level System**
    - Gradual increase in car speed at each level.
    - The player earns a point for each successful crossing.
  
  - **4. 7-Segment Display**
    - Player's score displayed on the **7-segment display** of the FPGA board.

- **C. Display**
  - Game displayed on a **VGA** screen connected to the FPGA board, with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.

- **D. Constraints**
  - Real-time operation with no noticeable latency.
  - Managing button bounces via a Verilog filter.
  - VGA display limited to 640x480 with 256 colors.

- **E. Risks and Assumptions**
  - **Development Time**: Delivery within a tight timeline; non-essential features may be set aside for a future version.
  - **Performance Risk**: Importance of hardware management for a good user experience.
  - **Compatibility**: Game must be compatible with the specified FPGA board.

### III. Technical Specifications

- **A. Graphic Convention**
  - **Background**: Black color (#000000).
  - **Frog**: 16x16 pixel sprite, green (#00FF00).
  - **Cars**: 16x32 pixel sprites, color varying by level.

- **B. Writing Convention**
  - Verilog conventions:
    - **UpperCamelCase** for modules (e.g., `FrogPlayer`).
    - **snake_case** for signals (e.g., `frog_position`).
    - Comments in **English**, starting with a capital letter and punctuation.

- **C. File Architecture**
  - Code organized into the following directories:
    - `src/`: Verilog source code.
    - `test/`: Unit tests.
    - `docs/`: Documentation.

- **D. Implementation**
  - Implementation steps:
    - Prototyping the base game.
    - Integrating components (frog, cars, display).
    - Testing and debugging features.
  
### IV. Additional Considerations

- **A. Cost Estimate**
  - Total estimated cost: **[insert cost]**.
  - Budget for hardware, tools, and miscellaneous expenses.

- **B. Performance**
  - Aim for **60 FPS** for optimal fluidity.
  - Regular performance testing throughout development.

- **C. Security**
  - **1. Data Security**
    - Protecting user data (if applicable) via secure storage methods.

### V. Success Evaluation
- Success measured by:
  - User feedback after deployment.
  - Adherence to deadlines and performance objectives.
  - Reduction of bugs detected during testing.
