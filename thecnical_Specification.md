## I. Project Introduction

### A. Client
- The **FroggyRanck** project is a reimagining of the arcade game **Frogger** on an **FPGA** board.
- Developed to provide a retro gaming experience with custom features.
- Aimed at a playful and educational audience.

### B. Project Objective
- To recreate a game on FPGA where the player controls a frog that must cross a road filled with cars to reach its destination.
- Includes VGA display mechanisms and hardware controls (buttons on the board).

## II. Solution

- ### A. Description
  - Developed in **Verilog** on the **[FPGA board name]**.
  - Display managed via VGA, with the player using the board's buttons to move the frog.
  - Each level becomes progressively more difficult with an increase in the number of obstacles.

- ### B. Components
  - #### 1. Frog (Player)
    - Controlled using the directional buttons on the FPGA board.
    - Frog sprite displayed on the VGA screen.
  
  - #### 2. Cars (Obstacles)
    - Randomly generated cars moving horizontally.
    - Variable speed of cars to increase difficulty.
  
  - #### 3. Level System
    - Gradual increase in car speed at each level.
    - The player earns a point for each successful crossing.
  
  - #### 4. 7-Segment Display
    - Player's score displayed on the **7-segment display** of the FPGA board.

- ### C. Display
  - Game displayed on a **VGA** screen connected to the FPGA board, with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.

- ### D. Constraints**
  - Real-time operation with no noticeable latency.
  - Managing button bounces via a Verilog filter.
  - VGA display limited to 640x480 with 256 colors.

- ### E. Risks and Assumptions**
  - **Development Time**: Delivery within a tight timeline; non-essential features may be set aside for a future version.
  - **Performance Risk**: Importance of hardware management for a good user experience.
  - **Compatibility**: Game must be compatible with the specified FPGA board.

## III. Technical Specifications

- ### A. Graphic Convention**
  - **Background**: Black color (#000000).
  - **Frog**: 16x16 pixel sprite, green (#00FF00).
  - **Cars**: 16x32 pixel sprites, color varying by level.
  
  ```verilog
  // Example sprite definition for the frog
  reg [15:0] frog_sprite [0:255]; // Store 16x16 sprite data
  initial begin
      $readmemh("frog_sprite.mem", frog_sprite);
  end
## B. Writing Convention
- **Verilog conventions**:
  - **UpperCamelCase** for modules (e.g., `FrogPlayer`).
  - **snake_case** for signals (e.g., `frog_position`).
  - Comments in English, starting with a capital letter and punctuation.

## C. File Architecture
- Code organized into the following directories:
  - `src/`: Verilog source code.
    - `frog/`: Contains frog-related logic.
    - `cars/`: Contains car-related logic.
    - `display/`: Contains display logic for VGA and 7-segment display.
  - `test/`: Unit tests.
    - Each component has corresponding test files (e.g., `frog_test.v`).
  - `docs/`: Project documentation, including design and user manuals.

## D. Implementation
- **Step 1: Prototyping the Base Game**
  - Initial game logic developed with basic mechanics.
  
  ```verilog
  // Pseudocode for game state management
  always @(posedge clk) begin
      case (game_state)
          START: begin
              // Initialize game variables
          end
          PLAY: begin
              // Main game loop
              update_frog_position();
              check_collisions();
              update_score();
          end
          GAME_OVER: begin
              // Display game over screen
              display_game_over();
          end
      endcase
  end
## Step 2: Integrating Components
- **Frog Controller**: Handles input and updates position.
- **Car Controller**: Generates cars with random speeds.

```verilog
// Example of frog position update based on input
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (btn_up) frog_position <= frog_position - 1;
    if (btn_down) frog_position <= frog_position + 1;
    if (btn_left) frog_position <= frog_position - 1;
    if (btn_right) frog_position <= frog_position + 1;
end
```
## Step 3: Testing and Debugging

- Continuous integration and regular debugging sessions.
- Utilize simulation tools for hardware behavior visualization.

## E. Signal Management
Effective signal management is critical for ensuring proper communication and synchronization between various components in the **FroggyRanck** project. This section outlines the strategies for input and output signal management, including debouncing techniques, synchronization, and signal processing.

## F. Input Signals:
- Button inputs debounced to prevent incorrect readings.

```verilog
// Debouncing logic
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (button_input) begin
        debounce_counter <= debounce_counter + 1;
    end else begin
        debounce_counter <= 0;
    end
end
```
## G. Output Signals
- VGA signals synchronized for smooth graphics rendering.
- 7-segment display outputs updated according to game score.

```verilog
// Example of updating the 7-segment display
always @(posedge clk) begin
    seven_segment_display <= score; // Assuming score fits in 7 segments
end
```
## H. Timing and Clocks
- Utilizing a 50 MHz clock with derived 25 MHz clock for VGA.
- Timing constraints ensuring game logic and rendering operate without latency.

## I. Memory Management
- Efficient memory allocation for sprites and dynamic data:

```verilog
// Example of sprite allocation
reg [15:0] sprite_memory [0:NUM_SPRITES-1];
initial begin
    $readmemh("sprites.mem", sprite_memory);
end
 ```
 ## J. Hardware Interfaces
- Defined interfaces for communication between components.
- Specific FPGA pins assigned for buttons, VGA output, and 7-segment display.

## K. Performance Metrics
- **Frame Rate**: Targeting 60 frames per second.
- **Input Response Time**: Processing inputs within 10 ms.

## L. Debugging and Testing
- Structured testing approach with unit and integration tests.
- Automated testing suite developed for efficiency.

## M. Documentation
- Inline comments within the code for clarity.
- High-level documentation explaining architecture and design decisions.

## N. Version Control
- Use of Git for collaborative development.
- Branching strategies for managing features and fixes.

## O. Risk Management
- Identified risks with mitigation strategies:
  - Prioritization of essential features.
  - Regular performance testing.
  - Schedule buffer for unexpected delays.

## P. Future Enhancements
- Plans for additional levels and challenges.
- Potential implementation of high score features.
- Exploration of networked multiplayer capabilities.

## Q. Security Considerations
- Measures in place to protect user data if collected.
- Prevent unauthorized access to FPGA and game data.

## R. Community Engagement
- Collect user feedback through surveys.
- Host forums for player suggestions and experiences.
- Plan beta testing sessions to refine game mechanics.

## S. Success Metrics
- Evaluating success based on user satisfaction and engagement.
- Monitoring performance metrics to ensure targets are met.
- Tracking gameplay statistics for ongoing improvement.

## Success Evaluation
- Success measured by:
  - User feedback after deployment.
  - Adherence to deadlines and performance objectives.
  - Reduction of bugs detected during testing.
  - Achievement of target frame rates and input response times.
