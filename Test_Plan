| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Smoke test | A smoke test is a quick and basic check or test performed to verify that it works on a fundamental level. A smoke test ensures that the main functionalities of a program or system are operational without delving into detailed or exhaustive testing. |
| Functional test | Functional testing is a process categorized as black-box testing. It constructs test cases based on the specified requirements of the software component under examination. |
| Regression test | A regression test is a check to ensure that recent changes to a software application haven't negatively impacted its existing functionalities. It helps catch unintended side effects or "regressions" that might occur when new features or updates are added. |
| Unit test | A unit test is a specific kind of testing conducted by developers on isolated components (units) of a software program. Developers create and execute unit tests to verify the correctness of individual functions or methods within the code. |
| Test case | A "test case" is a specific set of instructions or conditions that are designed to determine whether a software application, system, or component functions correctly under certain circumstances. It's a detailed scenario or situation used to verify that the software behaves as expected. |
